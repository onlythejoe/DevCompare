## Brief

The most cited tools for tracing, remote debugging, and incident analysis.

### Show HN
A grader is another deck type… but it’s designed to evaluate and score conversations (or individual conversation turns).<p>We also have test agents you can define on a deck-by-deck basis, that are designed to mimic scenarios your agent would face and generate synthetic data for either humans or graders to grade.<p>Prior to Gambit, we had built an LLM based video editor, and we weren’t happy with the results, which is what brought us down this path of improving inference time LLM quality.<p>We know it’s missing some obvious parts, but we wanted to get this out there to see how it could help people or start conversations. We’re really happy with how it’s working with some of our early design partners, and we think it’s a way to implement a lot of interesting applications:<p>- Truly open source agents and assistants, where logic, code, and prompts can be easily shared with the community.<p>- Rubric based grading to guarantee you (for instance) don’t leak PII accidentally<p>- Spin up a usable bot in minutes and have Codex or Claude Code use our command line runner / graders to build a first version that is pretty good w/ very little human intervention.<p>We’ll be around if ya’ll have any questions or thoughts.

## FAQ
- **How often does DevCompare refresh this page?** Daily automation pipelines fetch RSS updates and regenerate content so tables stay current.
- **Can I get notified when new comparisons publish?** Subscribe to the RSS feed at /rss.xml or use GitHub Pages deployment notifications.
- **Where do affiliate links point?** Every affiliate link resolves to vetted partners configured in config/affiliate.json.

## Summary Block

- **Last updated**: 2026-01-16T01:34:39.735Z

- **Focus**: Debugging & Observability

## Concluding Thoughts

Combine teleportation-like tooling with rich traces to spot regressions sooner.
