### Local-First vs Cloud
<strong><a href="https://vector.hyper-tools.online" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vector Gnome</a></strong> is built on a <strong>Local-First architecture</strong>.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>No Uploads:</strong> The "File" input stays in the browser's memory.</li> <li> <strong>No Servers:</strong> The optimization engine is a static bundle of JS/WASM.</li> <li> <strong>No Tracking:</strong> Your assets are yours. That SVG could contain company-sensitive icons, proprietary UI layouts, or even hidden metadata with your OS path.</p> <h4> Why I built Vector Gnome </h4> <p>I wanted a tool that felt like a cloud app but acted like a local binary.
