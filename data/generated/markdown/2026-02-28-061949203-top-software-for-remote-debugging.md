> Summary: Reliable remote debugging minimizes downtime and cognitive load.

## Summary Block

- **Last updated**: Feb 28, 2026

- **Focus**: Debugging & Observability

## Concluding Thoughts

Combine teleportation-like tooling with rich traces to spot regressions sooner.

## FAQ
- **How often does DevCompare refresh this page?** Daily automation pipelines fetch RSS updates, snapshot the context, and publish a new dated summary.
- **Can I get notified when new comparisons publish?** Subscribe to the RSS feed at rss.xml or follow the GitHub Pages release history.
- **Where do affiliate links point?** Every affiliate link resolves to vetted partners from config/affiliate.json.
- **How are archives and categories maintained?** Every pipeline run archives dated reports, assigns them to categories, and keeps the history intact.
